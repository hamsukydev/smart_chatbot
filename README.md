#Smart_Chatbot Deployment with Flask and JavaScript

In this tutorial we deploy the chatbot I created in this tutorial with Flask and JavaScript.

This gives 2 deployment options:

    Deploy within Flask app with jinja2 template
    Serve only the Flask prediction API. The used html and javascript files can be included in any Frontend application (with only a slight modification) and can run completely separate from the Flask App then.
    

#Initial Setup:

This repo currently contains the starter files.

Clone repo and create a virtual environment
